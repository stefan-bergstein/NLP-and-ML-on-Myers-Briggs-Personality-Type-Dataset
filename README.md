# NLP and ML on Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset
BYO Tweets and predict your Myers-Briggs Personality Type

---

**Why yet another kernel that explores the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset?**

- Exploring use of NLTK and XGBoost. 
- Practicing with the learnings from "[XGBoost With Python Mini-Course](https://machinelearningmastery.com/xgboost-python-mini-course/)".
- Trying out to build a model for each type indicator individually.
- And finally, predicting my own Myers-Briggs Personality Type.


### Outline

1. Data preview - distribution and correlation.
1. Data preparation - process posts, vectorize with count and tf-idf.
1. Apply steps of the "[XGBoost With Python Mini-Course](https://machinelearningmastery.com/xgboost-python-mini-course/)".
1. Predict own Myers-Briggs Personality Type base on a few tweets and blog post.
